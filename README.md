[Morse Cat <img src="src/cat.svg" height="16">](https://morse.cat) is yet another Morse code training tool.
But this one is special.
And not just because itâ€™s relying on the appeal of cats to draw your attention.
It is special because it gives you immediate feedback when you make a mistake.

This project relies on on [jscwlib](https://fkurz.net/ham/jscwlib.html) to actually produce sounds.
This is the JavaScript library that powers [LCWO](https://lcwo.net/).

Supported languages: English, French, Japanese, Spanish, Catalan, Mandarin, Hindi, Arabic (RTL), Bengali, Portuguese, Russian, Urdu (RTL).
