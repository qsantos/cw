1937 Koch Dissertation (Arbeitspsychologische Untersuchung der Tätigkeit bei der Aufnahme von Morsezeichen, zugleich ein neues Anlernverfahren für Funker)
- see https://qsantos.fr/2023/09/22/koch-dissertation-on-learning-morse-code/
- (page 27) the analytical method: transcribing heard Morse to paper as dots and dashes, then translating this to letters
    - breaks connection between sound and meaning
    - lots of back-and-forth between different modes (listening, writing, reading)
- (page 30) the sound method: first learn the optical representation, then learn to recognize sound
    - encourages the student to fallback to the optical representation
    - there is a plateau when student switch from optical mental model to sound mental model, w.r.t. increasing speed
    - Farnsworth?
    - the plateau is around 50 characters per minute, i.e. 10 WPM
    - (page 33) 1. Errors that prevent the formation of acoustic wholeness (shape, sound pattern)
        - Errors:
            - a) Detour via the optical symbol
            - b) Decomposition of the acoustic shape of the sign
            - c) Switching from listening to the decomposed sign to listening to the sound image.
        - Improvement:
            - a) Switching off the optical symbols.
            - b) Giving the sign in the form of the sound image
            - c) To give the sound image immediately at the beginning of the learning.
    - (page 33) 2. Errors that interfere with the formation of the unit of meaning between the acoustic impression and the letters
        - Errors:
            - a) Guessing which sign could come
            - b) Thinking about the sign during the lukewarm pause
            - c) Change from thinking and translating to the unity of meaning between the acoustic sign and the letters
            - d) Change in the overall rhythm
        - Improvement:
            - a) Giving the sign as a sound image.
            - b) Giving in a higher tempo.
            - c) High tempo already at the beginning of learning.
            - d) Begin with a fast tempo and maintain it.
- (page 34) Koch's approach
    - no optical representation
    - start at 60 characters per minute (12 WPM?)
    - different tones for dits and dahs, which are progressively brought together in the middle of the training
    - start with only two letters, than add more progressively
- (page 38) starting at 20 WPM seems harder on the students

1943 The Learning of Radiotelegraphic Code https://www.jstor.org/stable/1417382
- copy
    - no difference between starting with slow or fast characters
    - no difference in character learning order
    - no difference with immediate feedback
        - plaintext gives students immediate feedback
        - “Many experiments in the field of learning" have shown that reinforcement is most effective when it follows very closely in time the response which is to be learned”
- sending
    - no difference if hear symbol before sending it

- should be a thought-less process
- do not learn at 5 WPM
- directly go to phonetic, not visual
- “This method does not allow you to build that lookup table in your brain.”
- “constant positive reinforcement”
- “frustration is at a minimum”
